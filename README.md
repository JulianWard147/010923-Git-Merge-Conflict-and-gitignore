## Git Merge Practice

This is a practice repo set up for the 08082022 Data Science cohort to practice branches, Git merges, and merge conflicts.

This is at least partly a lesson in best practices, partly about what NOT to do, with a side note of resolving issues that do arise.

#### Instructions

1. Step one, clone this repo! Don't fork it, just clone it.

    >git clone https://github.com/JulianWard147/Git-Merge-Example

2. Step two, make a new branch named after yourself. 

    >git branch *your-name-here*

3. **Checkout that new branch**

    >git checkout *your-name-here*

4. **I repeat, checkout that new branch**

5. Open jupyter notebook, and add something, delete something, or in some way change some thing in the MainNotebook provided.

6. Make a new notebook called 'your-name-notebook', replacing your-name with your name, of course.

7. Make a new .txt file, put your deepest darkest secret inside of it, then add that file to the .gitignore

8. git add the MainNotebook and your new notebook, then git commit those changes with an appropriate comment.

9. Push ONLY YOUR BRANCH to the origin.

    Do:
    
    >git push origin *your-branch* 
    
    Not:

    >git push origin main

10. Open this link: https://github.com/JulianWard147/Git-Merge-Example.

11. Navigate over to the branches. 

12. Wait for further instruction.
